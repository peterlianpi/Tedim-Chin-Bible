<h1>This is the Bible translation in Tedim (Chin), Lai Siangtho to use with Propresenter 7. </h1>

<p>Included Bibles</br>
RVA is the version of Reina-Valera Antigua (RVA) and I overwrite files and modify translation file for Tedim (Chin) Bible (TDB). So Reina-Valera Antigua (RVA) version cannot be used. Aim to use Tedim (Chin) version.
|YLT|Young's Literal Translation|
|KJV|King James Version
