    <verse number="7" style="v" />Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:</para>
  <para style="p">

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</para>
  <para style="p">

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</para>

    <verse number="2" style="v" />And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />And Jesus answering said unto him, <char style="wj">Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</char> Then he suffered him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</para>
  <chapter number="4" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />But he answered and said, <char style="wj">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple,</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" />And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />Jesus said unto him, <char style="wj">It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />Then saith Jesus unto him, <char style="wj">Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee;</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,</para>

    <verse number="17" style="v" />From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, <char style="wj">Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />And he saith unto them, <char style="wj">Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</para>
