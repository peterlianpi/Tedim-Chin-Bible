	<chapter number="1" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />Paul, an apostle--not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who did raise him out of the dead--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />Grace to you, and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />who did give himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of the present evil age, according to the will of God even our Father,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />to whom [is] the glory to the ages of the ages. Amen.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />I wonder that ye are so quickly removed from Him who did call you in the grace of Christ to another good news;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />that is not another, except there be certain who are troubling you, and wishing to pervert the good news of the Christ;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />but even if we or a messenger out of heaven may proclaim good news to you different from what we did proclaim to you--anathema let him be!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />as we have said before, and now say again, If any one to you may proclaim good news different from what ye did receive--anathema let him be!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />for now men do I persuade, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if yet men I did please--Christ's servant I should not be.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />And I make known to you, brethren, the good news that were proclaimed by me, that it is not according to man,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught [it], but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />for ye did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />and when God was well pleased--having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called [me] through His grace--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />And the things that I write to you, lo, before God--I lie not;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that [are] in Christ,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />and only they were hearing, that `he who is persecuting us then, doth now proclaim good news--the faith that then he was wasting;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />and they were glorifying God in me.</para>
	<chapter number="2" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />Then, after fourteen years again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken with me also Titus;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />and I went up by revelation, and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations, and privately to those esteemed, lest in vain I might run or did run;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />but not even Titus, who [is] with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />and [that] because of the false brethren brought in unawares, who did come in privily to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, that us they might bring under bondage,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection, that the truth of the good news might remain to you.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />And from those who were esteemed to be something--whatever they were then, it maketh no difference to me--the face of man God accepteth not, for--to me those esteemed did add nothing,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />but, on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, as Peter with [that] of the circumcision,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, did work also in me in regard to the nations,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />and having known the grace that was given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who were esteemed to be pillars, a right hand of fellowship they did give to me, and to Barnabas, that we to the nations, and they to the circumcision [may go],</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />only, of the poor that we should be mindful, which also I was diligent--this very thing--to do.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />And when Peter came to Antioch, to the face I stood up against him, because he was blameworthy,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />for before the coming of certain from James, with the nations he was eating, and when they came, he was withdrawing and separating himself, fearing those of the circumcision,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />and dissemble with him also did the other Jews, so that also Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, `If thou, being a Jew, in the manner of the nations dost live, and not in the manner of the Jews, how the nations dost thou compel to Judaize?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />we by nature Jews, and not sinners of the nations,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law, if not through the faith of Jesus Christ, also we in Christ Jesus did believe, that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law, wherefore declared righteous by works of law shall be no flesh.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />And if, seeking to be declared righteous in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, [is] then Christ a ministrant of sin? let it not be!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />for if the things I threw down, these again I build up, a transgressor I set myself forth;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />for I through law, did die, that to God I may live;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />with Christ I have been crucified, and live no more do I, and Christ doth live in me; and that which I now live in the flesh--in the faith I live of the Son of God, who did love me and did give himself for me;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />I do not make void the grace of God, for if righteousness [be] through law--then Christ died in vain.</para>
	<chapter number="3" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey the truth--before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described before among you crucified?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />this only do I wish to learn from you--by works of law the Spirit did ye receive, or by the hearing of faith?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />so thoughtless are ye! having begun in the Spirit, now in the flesh do ye end?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />so many things did ye suffer in vain! if, indeed, even in vain.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />He, therefore, who is supplying to you the Spirit, and working mighty acts among you--by works of law or by the hearing of faith [is it]?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him--to righteousness;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />know ye, then, that those of faith--these are sons of Abraham,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God doth declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />`Blessed in thee shall be all the nations;' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for it hath been written, `Cursed [is] every one who is not remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of the Law--to do them,'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is evident, because `The righteous by faith shall live;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />and the law is not by faith, but--`The man who did them shall live in them.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it hath been written, `Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree,'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />Brethren, as a man I say [it], even of man a confirmed covenant no one doth make void or doth add to,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed; He doth not say, `And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, `And to thy seed,' which is Christ;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not set aside, to make void the promise,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />for if by law [be] the inheritance, [it is] no more by promise, but to Abraham through promise did God grant [it].</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise hath been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />and the mediator is not of one, and God is one--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />the law, then, [is] against the promises of God? --let it not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive, truly by law there would have been the righteousness,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />so that the law became our child-conductor--to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" />and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" />for ye are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" />for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" />there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all ye are one in Christ Jesus;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" />and if ye [are] of Christ then of Abraham ye are seed, and according to promise-- heirs.</para>
	<chapter number="4" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differeth nothing from a servant-- being lord of all,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />that those under law he may redeem, that the adoption of sons we may receive;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />and because ye are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, `Abba, Father!'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />so that thou art no more a servant, but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />But then, indeed, not having known God, ye were in servitude to those not by nature gods,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />and now, having known God--and rather being known by God--how turn ye again unto the weak and poor elements to which anew ye desire to be in servitude?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />days ye observe, and months, and times, and years!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />I am afraid of you, lest in vain I did labour toward you.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />Become as I [am] --because I also [am] as ye brethren, I beseech you; to me ye did no hurt,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />and ye have known that through infirmity of the flesh I did proclaim good news to you at the first,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />and my trial that [is] in my flesh ye did not despise nor reject, but as a messenger of God ye did receive me--as Christ Jesus;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />what then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that if possible, your eyes having plucked out, ye would have given to me;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />so that your enemy have I become, being true to you?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />they are zealous for you--[yet] not well, but they wish to shut us out, that for them ye may be zealous;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />and [it is] good to be zealously regarded, in what is good, at all times, and not only in my being present with you;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />my little children, of whom again I travail in birth, till Christ may be formed in you,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />and I was wishing to be present with you now, and to change my voice, because I am in doubt about you.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />Tell me, ye who are willing to be under law, the law do ye not hear?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />for it hath been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the maid-servant, and one by the free-woman,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />but he who [is] of the maid-servant, according to flesh hath been, and he who [is] of the free-woman, through the promise;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />which things are allegorized, for these are the two covenants: one, indeed, from mount Sinai, to servitude bringing forth, which is Hagar;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" />for this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and doth correspond to the Jerusalem that now [is], and is in servitude with her children,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" />and the Jerusalem above is the free-woman, which is mother of us all,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" />for it hath been written, `Rejoice, O barren, who art not bearing; break forth and cry, thou who art not travailing, because many [are] the children of the desolate--more than of her having the husband.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" />And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" />but as then he who was born according to the flesh did persecute him according to the spirit, so also now;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="30" style="v" />but what saith the Writing? `Cast forth the maid-servant and her son, for the son of the maid-servant may not be heir with the son of the free-woman;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="31" style="v" />then, brethren, we are not a maid-servant's children, but the free-woman's.</para>
	<chapter number="5" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free--stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />Ye were running well; who did hinder you--not to obey the truth?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />the obedience [is] not of him who is calling you!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />For ye--to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />for all the law in one word is fulfilled--in this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />and if one another ye do bite and devour, see--that ye may not by one another be consumed.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will--these ye may not do;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />and those who are Christ's, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" />if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" />let us not become vain-glorious--one another provoking, one another envying!</para>
	<chapter number="6" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />Brethren, if a man also may be overtaken in any trespass, ye who [are] spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself--lest thou also may be tempted;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />of one another the burdens bear ye, and so fill up the law of the Christ,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />for if any one doth think [himself] to be something--being nothing--himself he doth deceive;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />and his own work let each one prove, and then in regard to himself alone the glorying he shall have, and not in regard to the other,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />for each one his own burden shall bear.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />And let him who is instructed in the word share with him who is instructing--in all good things.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />Be not led astray; God is not mocked; for what a man may sow--that also he shall reap,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />because he who is sowing to his own flesh, of the flesh shall reap corruption; and he who is sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap life age-during;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />and in the doing good we may not be faint-hearted, for at the proper time we shall reap--not desponding;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />therefore, then, as we have opportunity, may we work the good to all, and especially unto those of the household of the faith.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />Ye see in how large letters I have written to you with my own hand;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />as many as are willing to make a good appearance in the flesh, these constrain you to be circumcised--only that for the cross of the Christ they may not be persecuted,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />for neither do those circumcised themselves keep the law, but they wish you to be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />And for me, let it not be--to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which to me the world hath been crucified, and I to the world;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />and as many as by this rule do walk--peace upon them, and kindness, and on the Israel of God!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />Henceforth, let no one give me trouble, for I the scars of the Lord Jesus in my body do bear.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with your spirit, brethren! Amen.</para>
