<h1>This is the Bible translation in Tedim (Chin), Lai Siangtho to use with Propresenter 7. </h1>

<p>Included Bibles</br>
RVA is the version of Reina-Valera Antigua (RVA) and I overwrite files and modify translation file for Tedim (Chin) Bible (TDB). So Reina-Valera Antigua (RVA) version cannot be used. Aim to use Tedim (Chin) version.
|YLT|Young's Literal Translation|
|KJV|King James Version
|BJB|Judson Bible

Expanding on @MGA's Answer

While it's not possible to embed a video in Markdown you can "fake it" by including a valid linked image in your markup file, using this format:

[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE "Video Title")

Explanation of the Markdown
If this markup snippet looks complicated, break it down into two parts:

an image
![image alt text](https://example.com/link-to-image)
wrapped in a link
[link text](https://example.com/my-link "link title")

Example using Valid Markdown and YouTube Thumbnail:
Everything Is AWESOME

We are sourcing the thumbnail image directly from YouTube and linking to the actual video, so when the person clicks the image/thumbnail they will be taken to the video.

Code:
[![Tedim (Chin) Bible for Propresenter 7](https://img.youtube.com/vi/tniCexLuzV8&t=304s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tniCexLuzV8&t=304s "Tedim (Chin) Bible for Propresenter 7")
