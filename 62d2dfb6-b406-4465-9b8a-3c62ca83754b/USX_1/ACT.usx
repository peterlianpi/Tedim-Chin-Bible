	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />to whom also he did present himself alive after his suffering, in many certain proofs, through forty days being seen by them, and speaking the things concerning the reign of God.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, [saith he,] `Ye did hear of me;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />because John, indeed, baptized with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit-- after not many days.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />They, therefore, indeed, having come together, were questioning him, saying, `Lord, dost thou at this time restore the reign to Israel?'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />and he said unto them, `It is not yours to know times or seasons that the Father did appoint in His own authority;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />but ye shall receive power at the coming of the Holy Spirit upon you, and ye shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the end of the earth.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />And these things having said--they beholding--he was taken up, and a cloud did receive him up from their sight;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />and as they were looking stedfastly to the heaven in his going on, then, lo, two men stood by them in white apparel,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />who also said, `Men, Galileans, why do ye stand gazing into the heaven? this Jesus who was received up from you into the heaven, shall so come in what manner ye saw him going on to the heaven.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />Then did they return to Jerusalem from the mount that is called of Olives, that is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />and when they came in, they went up to the upper room, where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zelotes, and Judas, of James;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />And in these days, Peter having risen up in the midst of the disciples, said, (the multitude also of the names at the same place was, as it were, an hundred and twenty,)</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />`Men, brethren, it behoved this Writing that it be fulfilled that beforehand the Holy Spirit spake through the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus,</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />this one, indeed, then, purchased a field out of the reward of unrighteousness, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed forth,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />and it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, insomuch that that place is called, in their proper dialect, Aceldama, that is, field of blood,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />for it hath been written in the book of Psalms: Let his lodging-place become desolate, and let no one be dwelling in it, and his oversight let another take.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />and having prayed, they said, `Thou, Lord, who art knowing the heart of all, shew which one thou didst choose of these two</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of fire; it sat also upon each one of them,</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto another, `Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we were born?</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one unto another, `What would this wish to be?'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />and others mocking said, --`They are full of sweet wine;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and declared to them, `Men, Jews! and all those dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and harken to my sayings,</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />(and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,)</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and to lay [them] upon couches and mats, that at the coming of Peter, even [his] shadow might overshadow some one of them;</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />so powerfully was the word of God increasing and prevailing.</para>
