	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, `Brood of vipers! who did shew you to flee from the coming wrath?</para>
