	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the Life--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you the Life, the age-during, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />that which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />and these things we write to you, that your joy may be full.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not at all;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />if we may say--`we have fellowship with Him,' and in the darkness may walk--we lie, and do not the truth;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light--we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son doth cleanse us from every sin;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />if we may say--`we have not sin,' ourselves we lead astray, and the truth is not in us;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />if we may confess our sins, stedfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />if we may say--`we have not sinned,' a liar we make Him, and His word is not in us.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />My little children, these things I write to you, that ye may not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />and he--he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands we may keep;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />he who is saying, `I have known him,' and his command is not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God hath been perfected; in this we know that in him we are.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />He who is saying in him he doth remain, ought according as he walked also himself so to walk.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old command, that ye had from the beginning--the old command is the word that ye heard from the beginning;</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is hating, in the darkness he is till now;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />he who is loving his brother, in the light he doth remain, and a stumbling-block in him there is not;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is, and in the darkness he doth walk, and he hath not known whither he doth go, because the darkness did blind his eyes.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />I write to you, little children, because the sins have been forgiven you through his name;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />I write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who [is] from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil. I write to you, little youths, because ye have known the Father:</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />I did write to you, fathers, because ye have known him who [is] from the beginning; I did write to you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God in you doth remain, and ye have overcome the evil.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />Love not ye the world, nor the things in the world; if any one doth love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />because all that [is] in the world--the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of the life--is not of the Father, but of the world,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />and the world doth pass away, and the desire of it, and he who is doing the will of God, he doth remain--to the age.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as ye heard that the antichrist doth come, even now antichrists have become many--whence we know that it is the last hour;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but--that they might be manifested that they are not all of us.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known all things;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />I did not write to you because ye have not known the truth, but because ye have known it, and because no lie is of the truth.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />every one who is denying the Son, neither hath he the Father, [he who is confessing the Son hath the Father also.]</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />Ye, then, that which ye heard from the beginning, in you let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the beginning ye did hear, ye also in the Son and in the Father shall remain,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" />and this is the promise that He did promise us--the life the age-during.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="26" style="v" />These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="27" style="v" />and you, the anointing that ye did receive from him, in you it doth remain, and ye have no need that any one may teach you, but as the same anointing doth teach you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, yeshall remain in him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="28" style="v" />And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before him, in his presence;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="29" style="v" />if ye know that he is righteous, know ye that every one doing the righteousness, of him hath been begotten.</para>
	<chapter number="3" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />See ye what love the Father hath given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world doth not know us, because it did not know Him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />and every one who is having this hope on him, doth purify himself, even as he is pure.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he doth do, and the sin is the lawlessness,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />and ye have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />every one who is remaining in him doth not sin; every one who is sinning, hath not seen him, nor known him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil doth sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />every one who hath been begotten of God, sin he doth not, because his seed in him doth remain, and he is not able to sin, because of God he hath been begotten.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />because this is the message that ye did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />not as Cain--of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and wherefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world doth hate you;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />we--we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother doth remain in the death.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />Every one who is hating his brother--a man-killer he is, and ye have known that no man-killer hath life age-during in him remaining,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his bowels from him--how doth the love of God remain in him?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in word and in truth!</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />because if our heart may condemn--because greater is God than our heart, and He doth know all things.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he doth remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He doth remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us.</para>
	<chapter number="4" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth to the world;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />in this know ye the Spirit of God; every spirit that doth confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />and every spirit that doth not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the antichrist, which ye heard that it doth come, and now in the world it is already.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />Ye--of God ye are, little children, and ye have overcome them; because greater is He who [is] in you, than he who is in the world.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />They--of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak, and the world doth hear them;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />we--of God we are; he who is knowing God doth hear us; he who is not of God, doth not hear us; from this we know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of God, and every one who is loving, of God he hath been begotten, and doth know God;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son--the only begotten--hath God sent to the world, that we may live through him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that He did love us, and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />Beloved, if thus did God love us, we also ought one another to love;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />God no one hath ever seen; if we may love one another, God in us doth remain, and His love is having been perfected in us;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />in this we know that in Him we do remain, and He in us, because of His Spirit He hath given us.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />And we--we have seen and do testify, that the Father hath sent the Son--Saviour of the world;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him doth remain, and he in God;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />and we--we have known and believed the love, that God hath in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in the love, in God he doth remain, and God in him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />In this made perfect hath been the love with us, that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even as He is, we--we also are in this world;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />fear is not in the love, but the perfect love doth cast out the fear, because the fear hath punishment, and he who is fearing hath not been made perfect in the love;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />we--we love him, because He--He first loved us;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="20" style="v" />if any one may say--`I love God,' and his brother he may hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom he hath seen, God--whom he hath not seen--how is he able to love?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="21" style="v" />and this [is] the command we have from Him, that he who is loving God, may also love his brother.</para>
	<chapter number="5" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he hath been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, doth love also him who is begotten of Him:</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />in this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God, and His commands may keep;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep, and His commands are not burdensome;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />because every one who is begotten of God doth overcome the world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world--our faith;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God?</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />This one is he who did come through water and blood--Jesus the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />because three are who are testifying [in the heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these--the three--are one;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />and three are who are testifying in the earth], the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />If the testimony of men we receive, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He hath testified concerning His Son.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="10" style="v" />He who is believing in the Son of God, hath the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar hath made Him, because he hath not believed in the testimony that God hath testified concerning His Son;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />and this is the testimony, that life age-during did God give to us, and this--the life--is in His Son;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />he who is having the Son, hath the life; he who is not having the Son of God--the life he hath not.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if anything we may ask according to his will, He doth hear us,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />and if we have known that He doth hear us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />We have known that every one who hath been begotten of God doth not sin, but he who was begotten of God doth keep himself, and the evil one doth not touch him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="19" style="v" />we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in the evil doth lie;</para>
