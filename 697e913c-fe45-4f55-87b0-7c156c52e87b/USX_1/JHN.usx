    <verse number="1" style="v" />In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The same was in the beginning with God.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" />All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" />In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" />And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.</para>

    <verse number="6" style="v" />There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" />The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" />He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" />That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" />He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" />He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" />But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" />And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" />John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" />And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" />For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" />No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" />And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" />And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" />Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" />He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" />John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" />He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="28" style="v" />These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="30" style="v" />This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="31" style="v" />And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="32" style="v" />And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="33" style="v" />And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="34" style="v" />And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</para>

    <verse number="37" style="v" />And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="38" style="v" />Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto them, <char style="wj">What seek ye?</char> They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="39" style="v" />He saith unto them, <char style="wj">Come and see.</char> They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth hour.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="40" style="v" />One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="41" style="v" />He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="42" style="v" />And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, <char style="wj">Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas,</char> which is by interpretation, A stone.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="43" style="v" />The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and findeth Philip, and saith unto him, <char style="wj">Follow me.</char></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="49" style="v" />Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="50" style="v" />Jesus answered and said unto him, <char style="wj">Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="51" style="v" />And he saith unto him, <char style="wj">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</char></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" />And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</para>
  <para style="p">

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" />But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" />And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</para>
  <chapter number="3" style="c" />
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" />There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" />The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</para>

    <char style="wj">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</char></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" />
    <char style="wj">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</char></para>
