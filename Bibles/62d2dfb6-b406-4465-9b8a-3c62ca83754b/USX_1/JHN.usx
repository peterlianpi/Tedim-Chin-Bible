	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />In him was life, and the life was the light of men,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />and the light in the darkness did shine, and the darkness did not perceive it.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="6" style="v" />There came a man--having been sent from God--whose name [is] John,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="7" style="v" />this one came for testimony, that he might testify about the Light, that all might believe through him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="8" style="v" />that one was not the Light, but--that he might testify about the Light.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="9" style="v" />He was the true Light, which doth enlighten every man, coming to the world;</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />to his own things he came, and his own people did not receive him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="12" style="v" />but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God--to those believing in his name,</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="32" style="v" />And John testified, saying--`I have seen the Spirit coming down, as a dove, out of heaven, and it remained on him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="33" style="v" />and I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whomsoever thou mayest see the Spirit coming down, and remaining on him, this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="34" style="v" />and I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="35" style="v" />On the morrow, again, John was standing, and two of his disciples,</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="2" style="v" />and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, `Wine they have not;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />Jesus saith to her, `What--to me and to thee, woman? not yet is mine hour come.'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />His mother saith to the ministrants, `Whatever he may say to you--do.'</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="11" style="v" />This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="13" style="v" />And the passover of the Jews was nigh, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the moneychangers sitting,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew,</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because of his knowing all [men],</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="25" style="v" />and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.</para>
	<chapter number="3" style="c" />

	<para style="p"><verse number="3" style="v" />Jesus answered and said to him, `Verily, verily, I say to thee, If any one may not be born from above, he is not able to see the reign of God;'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="4" style="v" />Nicodemus saith unto him, `How is a man able to be born, being old? is he able into the womb of his mother a second time to enter, and to be born?'</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="5" style="v" />Jesus answered, `Verily, verily, I say to thee, If any one may not be born of water, and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the reign of God;</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="14" style="v" />`And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so it behoveth the Son of Man to be lifted up,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="15" style="v" />that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during,</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="16" style="v" />for God did so love the world, that His Son--the only begotten--He gave, that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during.</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="17" style="v" />For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="18" style="v" />he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not believing hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</para>

	<para style="p"><verse number="22" style="v" />After these things came Jesus and his disciples to the land of Judea, and there he did tarry with them, and was baptizing;</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="23" style="v" />and John was also baptizing in Aenon, nigh to Salem, because there were many waters there, and they were coming and were being baptized--</para>
	<para style="p"><verse number="24" style="v" />for John was not yet cast into the prison--</para>

	<chapter number="4" style="c" />
	<para style="p"><verse number="1" style="v" />When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus more disciples doth make and baptize than John,</para>
